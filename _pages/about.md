# Hi there! 
I’m NrdyBhu1. I’m a software developer who likes open source work.  
This website is where i'd like to store my public notes *(basically blog)*.
I like to fool around with new programming languages.

`Fun fact`: I love vim

# Mostly used languages
 - C 
 - Rust 
 - Lua 
 - Javascript 
 - Python
