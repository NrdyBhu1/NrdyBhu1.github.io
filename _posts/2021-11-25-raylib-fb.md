# Installing freeBASIC compiler
Installing freeBASIC compiler comes first.
You can just grab the lastest version of <!--more-->freeBASIC compiler from [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fbc/files/).
For Linux users you can follow the lines of code below:
```sh
$ tar -xvf FreeBASIC-1.08.1-ubuntu-20.04-x86_64.tar.gz # I use ubuntu 20.04 (it might be different for you)
$ cd FreeBASIC-1.08.1-ubuntu-20.04-x86_64
$ sudo ./install.sh -i
```
That should do it.

# Installing raylib
Installing raylib comes next. Make sure you have `build-essentials`*(gcc, etc)* along with `cmake` installed.
Follow the instruction from the [raylib wiki](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib#installing-and-building-raylib-on-multiple-platforms) and install on your specific platform.
Static library build is preffered if possible and install it to the root.

# Fin
Finally only thing left is for final use, You can use the following code as base template.
```fb 
#include "raylib.bi"

const SCREEN_WIDTH = 800
const SCREEN_HEIGHT = 450

InitWindow(SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT, "raylib [core] example - basic window")

while not WindowShouldClose()
    BeginDrawing()
        ClearBackground(RAYWHITE)
        DrawText("Congrats! You created your first window!", 190, 200, 20, LIGHTGRAY)
    EndDrawing() 
wend

CloseWindow()
```
